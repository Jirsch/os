Upon establishing connection:
1. The server sends an uint32_t ( sizeof(uint32_t) bytes) indicating max file size

2. Assuming all is well (otherwise client exits and the socket is closed):

    3.1. The client sends a uint32_t of file name length (including null terminator)
    3.2. The client sends the file name (with null terminator)
    3.3. The client sends an uint32_t of the size of data
    3.4. The client sends the amount of data it said it will and closes the connection
