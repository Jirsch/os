Upon establishing connection:
1. The server sends an int (4 bytes) indicating max file size

2. The client replies with one byte of data: 0 if no more data will be sent and 1 otherwise

3. Assuming 1 was sent:

    3.1. The client sends an int of file name length (including null terminator)
    3.2. The client sends the file name (with null terminator)
    3.3. The client sends an int of the size of data
    3.4. The client sends the amount of data it said it will and closes the connection
