The problems with UDP are:
a. Not all the packets will surely arrive at the other side.
b. the packets may arrive not orderred;

We'll describe a reliable file transfer protocol over UDP connection
that overcomes the above problems.

first, the client will number all the packets and add the number to the 
packet. second, we will add to every packet the packet size 
(that will be shared by all packets) the number of packets. Then, we'll
send all the packets.

On the server side, we'll write to the file according to the packet 
number and the packet size (to an offset). After a time that we'll 
define the server will send to the clients the packet numbers that
it didn't get. the client will send those packets back and so on.

Only when the server got all the packets (let's remind that it holds
the number of packets), it will close the file.

It's obvious that it overcomes the problems mentioned above and
it is also efficient because it uses the UDP connction, which is very 
lightweight (because it doesn't order the packets or track connections).
