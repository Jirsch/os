FILES:
Block.cpp - Code for Block class, used to store block specific info (hash, parent etc.)
Block.h - Declare the thread class
BlockChainManager.cpp - Code for the BlockChainManager class, which does the actual logic of
                        maintaining a BlockChain as defined in the exercise
BlockChainManager.h - Header for the Manager class
blockchain.h - Declaration of library functions
Makefile

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
1. The separation between choosing a parent and the attaching (caused by async hash calculation)
is the cause for multi-pointing. The main parameter here is the ratio between rate of incoming
blocks and the duration of hash computation. We can change it via choice of quicker hash

 2. To rid ourselves of pruning, we could consider treating each block as if it was marked with
 the toLongest flag, thus parent computation will happen on-attach and thus the chain will
 continue always as a list rather than a tree
