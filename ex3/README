FILES:
Block.cpp - Code for Block class, used to store block specific info (hash, parent etc.)
Block.h - Declare the thread class
BlockChainManager.cpp - Code for the BlockChainManager class, which does the actual logic of
                        maintaining a BlockChain as defined in the exercise

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
1. The separation between choosing a parent and the attaching (caused by async hash calculation)
is the cause for multi-pointing. The main parameter here is the ratio between rate of incoming
blocks and the duration of hash computation. We can change it via choice of quicker hash

2. To rid ourselves of pruning, we could consider treating each block as if it was marked with
the toLongest flag, thus parent computation will happen on-attach and thus the chain will
continue always as a list rather than a tree

3. We didn't deal with the case where prune and add_block are called at the same time, which may
cause the new block to receive a non-minimal blockNum. This is caused by the fact that addBlock
should not be blocking.
