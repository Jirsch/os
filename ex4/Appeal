Code fixes:

- When renaming a FileDescriptor we use different behaviour whether its a file or a dir, but we
passed the old path to our isDir function, therefore directory renaming didn't affect cached
blocks. We simply changed the argument to the function.

- We had a problem calculating the number of blocks we need to read (either from cache or disc)
since we didn't take the offset into account.

General comment:
Our read function first reads whatever data it can from cache before loading blocks from disc;
this allows us to be more efficient when dealing with our cache. This may cause some tests to
fail if they assume a specific order of blocks being read, but it isn't against the exercise
description and in our opinion its a better way to deal with cache.

We think that this may be the cause for failure in tests cache_lfu_fail, offset_read_tail and
maybe cache_rename_file_fail
