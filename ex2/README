REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
1. RR has a pro in that that it is fair and prevents starvation, but has
a con in the fact that it offer no option for high priority actions (such as
listen to user input, or network activity). On the other hand, PQ has the two reversed,
the low priority thread would suffer extreme starvation which is a con, but at the
same time high priority actions will receive all the resources they will need which
is a pro.

2. Saving a file after editing will imply blocking the thread until the write
confirmation of the buffer is received.
